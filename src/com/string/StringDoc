the int length() method returns the number of characters in the string, including spaces and special characters like punctuation.

the String substring(int from, int to) method returns a string with the characters in the current string starting with the character at the from index and ending at the character before the to index (if the to index is specified, and if not specified it will contain the rest of the string).

the int indexOf(String str) method returns the index of the beginning of str in the current string or -1 if it isnâ€™t found.

the int compareTo(String other) returns a negative value if the current string is less than the other string, 0 if they have the same characters in the same order, and a positive value if the current string is greater than the other string.

the boolean equals(String other) returns true when the characters in the current string are the same as the ones in the other string. This method is inherited from the Object class, but is overriden which means that the String class has its own version of that method.
